# My Portfolio

## Summary

A personal portfolio website built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript, showcasing my projects, and contact information. The site features a custom animated loader, a responsive and transparent navigation bar, interactive mobile navigation, and a modern, professional design.

## Key Features

- Animated loader
- Responsive header 
- Mobile menu 
- Social media links and custom theming.
- Project cards in a responsive grid, all with consistent height for alignment.
- "About Me" and "Technical Skills" sections with concise, professional descriptions.
- Fully responsive contact section with selectable contact method (WhatsApp, Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok) that opens the appropriate app/site and pre-fills the user's message.
- Built mobile-first, fully responsive for all screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or deploy to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).
3. Update your contact details and social/profile links in the HTML as needed.

## Future Improvements

- As my learing progresses i look forward to rebuilding the portfolio with React for better scalability, maintainability, and interactivity.
- Add backend integration for storing messages or sending emails directly.
- Add more animations and transitions for enhanced user experience.
